## Data specialist || Marine ecologist

My mission is to make **complicated ideas** clear and **easy to understand**. My work is dedicated to creating meaningful information from data and to make knowledge **accessible to everyone**. I do this with data analysis and visualisation, as well as through creating educational materials on marine ecology topics (and others!).

I am based in Barcelona but I work everywhere.

Feel free to contact me.
