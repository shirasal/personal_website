My studies included a research project on the effects of fish farms in open seas.\n\nDuring my Master studies I learned and practiced most of my data science skills, mainly using R, Rstudio (now 'posit') and GitHub.  \nI also started a Github account for our lab, initiated a Google website platform for our fish identification guide (which we all built together), gathered and cleaned our Mediterranean database and lead lab hackathons.  \nMy research topic was \"Dynamic fish networks along environmental gradients in the Mediterranean Sea\".\n\n\n\n## Skills\n\n### Data processing, analysis and visualisation\n-   **R language, RStudio, Rmarkdown**.\n-   Spreadsheet softwares: **Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets**.\n-   Geographical information systems (**GIS**): qGIS, ArcGIS.\n-   **GitHub** repositories, version control and collaboration tools\n-   Basic understanding of **SQL**\n-   Data analysis with **Python** (namely pandas library)\n\n### Science communication\n-   Public speaking\n-   Presentations creation (**Microsoft PowerPoint**, **Google Slides**, **RMarkdown**)\n-   Article writing (blog posts, popular science)\n-   Scientific report writing\n\n### Natural languages\n-   English: proficient, fluent.\n-   Hebrew: native.\n-   Spanish (Castellano): beginner (B1).\n\n\n\\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{\n  \\textcolor{gray}{\n    This CV was built with the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package.\n    }\n  }"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":{"vitae::latexcv":{"theme":"classic"}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"email-obfuscation":"references","output-file":"my_cv.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"minty","minimal":false,"anchor-sections":false,"name":"Shira","surname":"Salingre","position":"Marine Ecologist | Data Analyst","email":"shira.salin@gmail.com","www":"shirasal.github.io","github":"shirasal","linkedin":"shira-salingre"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
